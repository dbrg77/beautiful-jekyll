### My education background

I will write something when I have time.

### Some random thoughts about myself:

- I have a typical Chinese name (Xi Chen, 陈曦).  

- I like certain types of music, including folk, gothic metal, death metal, melodic death metal, power metal, progressive metal.  

- I play one computer game: Diablo II. I've been playing this game over and over again for years, and I have found the rarest item in the entire game (Tyrael's Might).

- I also play some 8-bit NES games: the Ninja Gaiden triology, Megaman 1 and 2, Castlevania.  

- My friends say I'm a geek.  

- I used to be good at sports, [click here](https://flic.kr/s/aHskDDW8Y1) for some sort of proof.
