### My background

I did my BSc in Experimental Medicine in Peking University Health Science Centre in Beijing, where I became interested in all the techniques used in biochemistry and molecular biology. After graduation, I joined Prof. Andrew Sharrocks' lab at the University of Manchester as a PhD student, studying the DNA binding specificity of different Forkhead transcription factors. During this period, I discovered an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor complex that regulates G2/M cell cycle transition.

After my PhD, I joined Dr. Sarah Teichmann's group at the EBI as a postdoc to investiage T helper cell 2 (Th2) differentiation from an epigenetic point of view. In 2016, the Teichmann lab moved to the Sanger Institute, and I became a Senior Staff Scientist in the lab. During that period, I was mainly working on techniques to interrogate the gene expression and epigentic profiles at the single cell level. I developed a simple and robust way of performing scATAC-seq so that everybody can easily investigate chromatin accessibility at the single cell level.

In 2019, I joined the Department of Biology in SUSTech, Shenzhen, China as an Assistant Professor. My lab study transcriptional regulation in cell fate decision and memory. My lab website is coming soon ... hopefully ...

### About this website

I write stuff here to explain things that I'm trying to understand for my own education. The theme for this website is forked from [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/). If you are into genomics data, you will be very familiar with the favicon of this website. It is a genome coverage track screenshot taken from a scATAC-seq data from one of my experiments.

### Some random thoughts about myself:

- I have a typical Chinese name (Xi Chen, 陈曦).  

- I like certain types of music, including folk, gothic metal, death metal, melodic death metal, power metal, progressive metal. Most of my favourite bands are from Finland, Sweden and Norway.  

- I play one computer game: Diablo II. I've been playing this game over and over again for years, and I have found the rarest item in the entire game (Tyrael's Might).

- I also play some 8-bit NES games: the Ninja Gaiden triology, Megaman 1 and 2, Castlevania.
